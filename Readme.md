Using the DeepPavlov or any other QA model for large documents might have some limitations, mainly due to context length. Most pre-trained QA models have a context length limit, usually around 512 tokens. If your documents exceed this length, you'll need to split them into smaller chunks.

### Handling Large Documents

To ensure accuracy with large documents, you can:

1. **Split the Document into Chunks**: Divide the document into smaller overlapping chunks and apply the QA model to each chunk.
2. **Select the Best Answer**: Aggregate the answers from all chunks and select the best one based on confidence scores.

Here's how you can implement this approach:

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install deeppavlov
   ```

2. **Modify the Code to Handle Large Documents**:

```python
import os
from deeppavlov import build_model, configs
from whoosh import index
from whoosh.fields import Schema, TEXT, ID
from whoosh.qparser import QueryParser

# Define the schema and create the index
schema = Schema(title=ID(stored=True, unique=True), content=TEXT(stored=True))
index_dir = "indexdir"
if not os.path.exists(index_dir):
    os.mkdir(index_dir)

ix = index.create_in(index_dir, schema)

# Add documents to the index
writer = ix.writer()
documents = [
    {"title": "Document1", "content": "The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower from 1887 to 1889."},
    {"title": "Document2", "content": "This is the content of document two. It discusses machine learning and AI."},
    {"title": "Document3", "content": "Here is the content of document three. It covers web development using Flask."}
]

for doc in documents:
    writer.add_document(title=doc["title"], content=doc["content"])

writer.commit()

# Load the DeepPavlov QA model
qa_model = build_model(configs.squad.squad, download=True)

# Function to get the relevant document content for a query
def get_relevant_content(query_str):
    ix = index.open_dir(index_dir)
    with ix.searcher() as searcher:
        query = QueryParser("content", ix.schema).parse(query_str)
        results = searcher.search(query)
        return " ".join([result['content'] for result in results])

# Function to split text into chunks
def split_into_chunks(text, max_chunk_size=512, overlap=50):
    words = text.split()
    chunks = []
    start = 0
    while start < len(words):
        end = min(start + max_chunk_size, len(words))
        chunks.append(" ".join(words[start:end]))
        start += max_chunk_size - overlap
    return chunks

# Function to get the answer from the QA model
def get_answer(question, context):
    chunks = split_into_chunks(context)
    answers = []
    for chunk in chunks:
        result = qa_model([chunk], [question])
        answers.append((result[0][0], result[1][0]))  # (answer, confidence)
    best_answer = max(answers, key=lambda x: x[1])
    return best_answer[0]

# Example search queries
user_query1 = "where is the Eiffel Tower?"
user_query2 = "who is the Eiffel Tower named after?"

context1 = get_relevant_content(user_query1)
context2 = get_relevant_content(user_query2)

answer1 = get_answer(user_query1, context1)
answer2 = get_answer(user_query2, context2)

print(f"Question: {user_query1}\nAnswer: {answer1}\n")
print(f"Question: {user_query2}\nAnswer: {answer2}\n")
```

### Explanation

1. **Splitting Large Documents**:
   - The `split_into_chunks` function splits the document into smaller chunks of a specified maximum size (e.g., 512 tokens) with some overlap (e.g., 50 tokens) to ensure context continuity.

2. **Handling Large Contexts**:
   - The `get_answer` function applies the QA model to each chunk and aggregates the answers.
   - It selects the best answer based on confidence scores provided by the QA model.

### Running the Example

This approach ensures that the QA model can handle large documents by splitting them into manageable chunks. The QA model processes each chunk individually, and the best answer is selected from all chunks based on confidence scores. This method provides more accurate results for larger documents.
