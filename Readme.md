Creating an advanced receipt parser without using Tesseract involves relying solely on deep learning and NER (Named Entity Recognition) techniques. Hereâ€™s a structured approach and snippets of code to guide you through the process using Python:

### Steps to Create an Advanced Receipt Parser without Tesseract

#### Step 1: Data Collection and Annotation

1. **Collect Receipt Images**: Gather a diverse set of receipt images. Ensure they cover different layouts, fonts, and styles.

2. **Annotation**: Annotate these receipts to mark fields such as date, merchant name, total amount, items purchased, etc. You can use tools like LabelImg or manually create annotations.

#### Step 2: Preprocessing

1. **Image Preprocessing**: Resize, normalize, and enhance contrast of receipt images to improve OCR performance.

2. **Text Extraction**: Use a deep learning approach to directly extract text from images. This can be achieved using models like CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network).

#### Step 3: Model Architecture

1. **NER Model**: Utilize a pre-trained NER model like BERT or train a custom NER model using deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

2. **Sequence Labeling**: Implement a sequence labeling approach (e.g., BiLSTM-CRF) to tag each token (word or part of a word) with its corresponding entity (e.g., DATE, AMOUNT, ITEM, etc.).

#### Step 4: Training the Model

1. **Data Preparation**: Split annotated data into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **Feature Extraction**: Use image embeddings or features extracted from CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) layers for image text extraction.

3. **Model Training**: Train the NER model on the annotated dataset. Fine-tune a pre-trained NER model on your specific receipt data to improve accuracy.

#### Step 5: Integration and Parsing

1. **JSON Output**: Parse the text extracted from images using the trained NER model to extract relevant fields (date, merchant, total amount, items purchased) and format them into a JSON structure.

### Example Code Snippets

Here are simplified snippets to illustrate key parts of the implementation:

#### Example Image Text Extraction

```python
# Example using a deep learning model (CRNN) for text extraction from receipt images
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Define a CRNN model for text extraction from images
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(height, width, channels)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

# Train the model on your dataset
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(val_images, val_labels))

# Use the trained model to extract text from receipt images
extracted_text = model.predict(test_images)
```

#### Example NER Model Training and Usage

```python
import spacy
from spacy.training.example import Example

# Load a pre-trained SpaCy model for NER
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')

# Example training loop for custom NER
for epoch in range(10):
    for text, annotations in annotated_data:
        doc = nlp.make_doc(text)
        example = Example.from_dict(doc, annotations)
        nlp.update([example], losses={})

# Save the trained NER model
nlp.to_disk('path_to_save_model')

# Use the trained model to extract entities from text
doc = nlp("Text extracted from receipt image")
for ent in doc.ents:
    print(ent.text, ent.label_)
```

#### Example JSON Output

```python
import json

# Example of parsing and formatting extracted entities into JSON
parsed_data = {
    "merchant": "ABC Store",
    "date": "2024-07-05",
    "total_amount": "$50.00",
    "items": [
        {"name": "Item 1", "quantity": 1, "price": "$10.00"},
        {"name": "Item 2", "quantity": 2, "price": "$20.00"}
    ]
}

# Convert to JSON
json_data = json.dumps(parsed_data, indent=2)
print(json_data)
```

### Notes

- **Complexity**: Implementing an advanced receipt parser without Tesseract requires expertise in deep learning, NER techniques, and handling diverse receipt formats.
  
- **Customization**: Adapt the steps and models according to your specific receipt layout and data requirements.
  
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of your models using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score on a separate test dataset.

This approach combines deep learning for image text extraction and NER for structured data extraction, providing a robust solution for receipt parsing without relying on OCR libraries like Tesseract.
