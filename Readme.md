The error "list object cannot be interpreted as integer" typically occurs when there's a mismatch in how data is accessed or structured within a Python script, especially when dealing with lists and indices. This error often arises due to attempting to access elements in a list incorrectly, assuming an integer where a list or vice versa. Let's address how to handle this issue in the context of preparing data for training a spaCy NER model using your JSON format.

### Addressing the Error

Given your JSON data format `[[ocr_text, {"entities": [[start, end, label], ...]}], ...]`, where each sublist contains OCR text and corresponding entity annotations, we need to ensure that the data is correctly formatted when converting it into spaCy's training format.

### Revised Approach

Let's adjust the script to properly handle the conversion of your JSON data into spaCy format and ensure it correctly creates `Example` objects for training.

### Example Correction

Here's how you can modify the script to avoid the error and correctly prepare the data for training:

```python
import spacy
import random
import json
from spacy.training import Example
from paddleocr import PaddleOCR

# Initialize PaddleOCR
ocr = PaddleOCR(use_angle_cls=True, lang='en')

def get_text_from_image(image_path):
    # Run OCR on the image
    result = ocr.ocr(image_path, cls=True)
    
    # Extract text from the OCR result
    text_lines = []
    for line in result:
        for res in line:
            text_lines.append(res[1][0])  # res[1][0] contains the recognized text

    # Join all text lines into a single string
    text = '\n'.join(text_lines)
    return text

# Load spaCy English model with blank pipeline
nlp = spacy.blank("en")

# Add NER component to the pipeline using the string name
ner = nlp.add_pipe("ner")

# Load your training data from JSON
with open("train_data.json", "r") as f:
    train_data = json.load(f)

# Define function to convert data to spaCy format
def convert_data_to_spacy(data):
    ner_data = []
    for entry in data:
        ocr_text = entry[0]
        entities = entry[1]['entities']
        entities_spacy = []
        
        for start, end, label in entities:
            entities_spacy.append((start, end, label))
        
        ner_data.append((ocr_text, {"entities": entities_spacy}))
    
    return ner_data

# Convert data to spaCy format
formatted_data = convert_data_to_spacy(train_data)

# Add labels to the NER component
for entry in train_data:
    for start, end, label in entry[1]['entities']:
        ner.add_label(label)

# Initialize the optimizer
optimizer = nlp.begin_training()

# Train the NER model
for itn in range(10):  # Example: Train for 10 iterations
    random.shuffle(formatted_data)
    losses = {}
    
    for text, annotations in formatted_data:
        doc = nlp.make_doc(text)
        example = Example.from_dict(doc, annotations)
        nlp.update([example], drop=0.5, sgd=optimizer, losses=losses)
    
    print(f"Iteration {itn+1}: Losses - {losses}")

# Save the trained model
nlp.to_disk("trained_ner_model")

# Example usage: Test the trained model
test_image_path = "path_to_test_receipt_image.jpg"
test_text = get_text_from_image(test_image_path)
doc = nlp(test_text)
print("Entities:", [(ent.text, ent.label_) for ent in doc.ents])
```

### Explanation and Changes

1. **Data Conversion (`convert_data_to_spacy`)**:
   - The function now correctly extracts `start`, `end`, and `label` from each entity in `train_data` and adds them to `entities_spacy`.

2. **Adding Labels**:
   - Labels are added to the NER component using `ner.add_label(label)` for each entity in `train_data`.

3. **Training Loop**:
   - The script iterates over `formatted_data`, creates spaCy `Example` objects using `Example.from_dict`, and updates the NER model.

4. **Testing the Model**:
   - After training, you can test the model using `get_text_from_image` to extract text from a new receipt image and print recognized entities.

### Running the Script

- **Prepare Training Data**: Ensure your `train_data.json` follows the correct format `[ocr_text, {"entities": [[start, end, label], ...]}]`.
  
- **Run the Script**: Execute the script to train the NER model. Adjust the number of iterations (`itn`) and other parameters as needed.

- **Evaluate and Refine**: Test the trained model with new receipt texts. Continue refining by annotating more data and adjusting training parameters based on performance.

This approach ensures that your NER model training process handles the JSON data correctly without encountering "list object cannot be interpreted as integer" errors, maintaining clarity and correctness in data handling and model training.
