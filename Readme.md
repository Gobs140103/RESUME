To allow users to export transaction results to an Excel file in your Rasa chatbot, you can follow these steps:

1. **Fetch Transaction Data:**
   Query your Oracle database to retrieve the transaction data using `cx_Oracle`.

2. **Generate Excel File:**
   Use the `pandas` library to create a DataFrame and export it to an Excel file.

3. **Send the File to the User:**
   Serve the generated Excel file to the user via a download link or send it as an attachment.

Here's a step-by-step implementation:

### Step 1: Query the Database

First, ensure you have `cx_Oracle` and `pandas` installed:
```bash
pip install cx_Oracle pandas openpyxl
```

### Step 2: Create a Custom Action to Query and Export Data

In your Rasa project, create a custom action to handle the database query and file creation.

**actions.py:**
```python
import cx_Oracle
import pandas as pd
from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher
from rasa_sdk.types import DomainDict

class ActionExportTransactions(Action):

    def name(self) -> str:
        return "action_export_transactions"

    def run(self, dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher, tracker: Tracker, domain: DomainDict) -> list:
        # Establish the database connection
        connection = cx_Oracle.connect(user="your_username", password="your_password", dsn="your_dsn")
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        
        # Query the database
        query = "SELECT * FROM transactions"
        cursor.execute(query)
        rows = cursor.fetchall()

        # Get column names
        col_names = [row[0] for row in cursor.description]
        
        # Create a DataFrame
        df = pd.DataFrame(rows, columns=col_names)
        
        # Export to Excel
        file_path = "/path/to/exported_transactions.xlsx"
        df.to_excel(file_path, index=False)

        # Close the connection
        cursor.close()
        connection.close()
        
        # Inform the user and provide download link
        dispatcher.utter_message(text=f"Your transaction data has been exported successfully. You can download it [here](http://yourserver.com/files/exported_transactions.xlsx)")
        
        return []
```

### Step 3: Handle File Serving

You'll need to serve the file via a web server so the user can download it. You can use Flask to handle this.

**app.py (Flask):**
```python
from flask import Flask, send_from_directory

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/files/<filename>')
def download_file(filename):
    return send_from_directory("/path/to", filename)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8000)
```

Make sure your Rasa action server and Flask server are running. The `dispatcher.utter_message` in the custom action provides a link to download the file.

### Step 4: Add the Custom Action to Your Rasa Domain

**domain.yml:**
```yaml
actions:
- action_export_transactions
```

### Step 5: Update Your Stories or Rules

Ensure you have a story or rule that triggers the `action_export_transactions` action.

**stories.yml:**
```yaml
stories:
- story: export transactions
  steps:
  - intent: export_transactions
  - action: action_export_transactions
```

This setup will allow users to request an export of their transactions, and your bot will handle querying the database, creating an Excel file, and providing a link for the user to download the file.
